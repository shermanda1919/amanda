      <div class="about">Hello everyone, my name is Amanda Sherman and I'm a rising junior in high school. A month ago, one question kept on bothering me. Why do a select few group of people gain access to opportunities while others don't even know where to start looking? The answer is connections. Through parents, family friends, and even social media, those who are on the hunt for internships and summer programs gain tremendous advantages over their peers. <br>

      <h1></h1>

      This is simply not fair. I remember being shocked when I discovered a whole community of student entrepreneurs on LinkedIn. In the past, I never was one of those well connected students. Now, everything is suddenly way more open! I want to bring the same force of change to all high schoolers that I've experienced during these past few months. No longer will youth have to toil for hours on end searching up opportunities. Our platform will solve this problem. <br>

      <h1></h1>
